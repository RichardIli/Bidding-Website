* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
* **API**: A custom-built, simple JSON API for item data.

## üß† What I Learned

This project was a fantastic opportunity to practice several key concepts:

* **Modular JavaScript**: The biggest improvement was refactoring the monolithic `main.js` file into separate, reusable modules (`app.js`, `ui.js`, `api.js`). This significantly improved code organization and made the project much easier to maintain.
* **State Management**: I learned how to manage application state on the frontend (`allItems`, `myBids`) and ensure the UI stays synchronized with the data.
* **Event Handling**: Implementing event listeners dynamically for newly rendered elements was a core challenge. I solved this by using event delegation and ensuring listeners are set up after a render.
